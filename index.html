        <h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm David! <br></h1>
        <h2>a python dev focused on automation & AI</h2>
        <p>
          My journey as a <strong>Developer</strong> began after gaining experience in various fields, starting as an IT Support intern and later working as a Systems Assistant before progressing to Analyst roles. <br><br>
          At a certain point, while still working as an assistant at the company, a need arose to automate processes in the Commercial department, and the responsibility fell on me.

          I embraced the opportunity without hesitation and began my journey in <strong>RPA (Robotic Process Automation)</strong> development using <strong>UiPath</strong>. <br><br>
          
          From the very first moment, I was fascinated by seeing the impact of my work on the team's productivity. This sparked a deeper interest in automation, leading me to further my studies and start learning <b>Python</b>.
          <br><br>
          Since then, I have been specializing in Python with a focus on process automation, while also exploring <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>,
          and <strong>Data Science</strong>. My pursuit of knowledge is continuous, always aiming to become an increasingly skilled and prepared professional for future challenges.

          Bachelor of Technology in Systems Analysis and Development
        </h3>
        <p>
          Graduated in Systems Analysis and Development, I began my professional journey in technology as an End User Support, where I had direct contact with end-users.
          This experience was crucial in honing my soft skills, especially communication and problem-solving. <br>
          Later, I transitioned to the systems field, managing software development projects and acting as a bridge between technical teams and clients, 
          ensuring their needs were fully met. <br>
          Currently, I work as an RPA Developer with expertise in UiPath, Python, and process analysis. 
          My focus is on automating manual and repetitive tasks, streamlining workflows, and enhancing operational efficiency.<br>
          I am dedicated to aligning technology with business strategies, driving digital transformation, and fostering continuous improvement.

              Salesforce Automation: <br>Company Deployment Process in Salesforce with UiPath
            </h3>
            <p>
              The manual process involved receiving a spreadsheet from the broker by email, 
              downloading it, and manually entering the data into Salesforce. <br>UiPath was used for automation, 
              with a flowchart created for both the manual and RPA processes. The RPA was developed to automatically handle emails, 
              download spreadsheets, save cell values in variables, and populate Salesforce fields with these values.

              Product Registration Automation in ERP with Python

            <p>
              A company needed to migrate 5,000 products from one ERP system to another, which would have taken months. <br>
              I used Python and Selenium to automate capturing the fields from the product spreadsheet and entering them 
              into the new ERP system. This process was completed in a few hours, saving months of repetitive work.

              Automating Customer Load in the System using Power Automate
            </h3>
            <p>
              This task involved updating a customer spreadsheet connected to a database, 
              creating two copies of the spreadsheet (one for additions and one for modifications), 
              and modifying the column in the modification copy. Then, each spreadsheet was converted from .xlsx to .csv and split into two parts. 
              After these steps, the four resulting files were uploaded to the system to update the customers.
              This entire process was automated using Microsoft's Power Automate tool.
